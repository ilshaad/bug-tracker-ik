## What is the app about?

It is a Bug Tracker app (aka. Issue Tracker). Intended for developers as a social board for discovering bugs that may be plaguing applications.
Developers can:

- Report new bugs they may have found.
- Assign themselves (or assign another developer) to fix the bug.
- Ask for help.
- Commenting.
- and more...

## Main technologies I used in the app:

- React
- Typescript / Javascript
- Node.js / Express
- PostgreSql
- Redux
- Webpack
- Auth0
- Bootstrap
- Docker
- Render
- PWA (Workbox)
- etc...

## Some key points about the app:

- _Frontend folder_:
  - _Redux_.
    - You can use _Redux devtool_ extension on the browser to view all the state data.
  - _Webpack_ template set up.
  - Mobile first approach, design ranging `320px-1600px`.
- _Backend folder_:
  - _Node.js_ & _Express_.
  - _Heroku PostreSql_ as database.
  - MVC structure.
- _Auth0_ setup for user authentication.
- Client Side Render app.
- App stored within _Docker_ containers.
- _Github Actions_ CI/CD pipeline setup, automates to _Heroku_ as live site when git push to `master` branch.
- CRUD operation
- REST API
